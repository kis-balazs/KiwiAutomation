# KiwiAutomation
My python-based project to create a flight searching system using kiwi.com public API.

Created:
 - simple GUI
 - round-trips can be managed for the time being only
 - options to add multiple source and arrival destinations
 - options to add dates of flight - return
 - filtering flights after some pre-given parameters - it will sort the flights after these parameters, 
   modifiable by code (shortest summed flight time, checked baggage price)
 - automatical link access of the booking

Want to create:
 - different types of flights (one-way, multiple stops, etc.)
 - add more filters
 - option to give a bigger time interval and multiple options (filters, number of days at the destination, preferences),
   and the system to fing the ideal flights according to these parameters
 - use more complex analytical - mathematical systems to predict best periods of the year
 - automatic booking system after given credentials, with steps until checkout
 
** Changes will be updated periodicall.

This is a personal, open project for anyone who would like to continue, give ideas, etc., you are welcome to do it,
feel free to star it, fork it, etc. Better solutions are welcomed as well, or even alternate solutions.**
